# Gaia Content Server Plugin

**Note:** You do not need to configure this plugin if you use the Gaia Live Development plugin.

The Gaia Content Server plugin allows Gaia to access local folders,
sub-folders, and files through a URL. The URL typically has the following
format, and is always available when the Gaia server is running:
`http://[Gaia domain]/api/routes/contentserver/content/[alias]`

For example, if you enter `css` for the alias and `C:\mycode\css`
for the relative or absolute path, the contents of `C:\mycode\css`
are exposed through `http://localhost:9001/api/routes/contentserver/content/css`.

After you add or remove an alias and relative or absolute path, the changes are automatically saved and you do not need to restart Gaia. 
New aliases are immediately accessible through the URL. 

To access the Gaia Content Server plugin in Gaia, click the `Content Server` tab on the plugin list on the left.

## Configure a Content URL

Complete the following steps to configure the Content URL in the Content
Server plugin:

1.  In the Alias box, enter the name of the local folder that should be
    accessed in the URL.

2.  In the Relative or Absolute Path box, enter the path for the folder
    referenced by the alias. All contents in this folder will be
    accessible through the alias.

3.  Click `Add`. The system associates the relative or absolute
    path with the alias and displays the associated entry on the table
    under the Add button.

4.  If you want to delete an alias and folder association, click
    `Delete` to the right of the association you want to delete. The
    system removes the association from the table and Gaia can no longer
    access that location.
