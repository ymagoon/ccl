# How to Get Started with Bedrock Mocks

1.  In a logical location (probably close to your existing `mocks` folder), add a folder (if it doesn't already exist) called `bedrockMocks`
2.  Create an empty javascript file in that folder
3.  Use Gaia and Live Dev to "Launch" your artifact in a domain (ensure your component is on the first tab in the viewpoint)
4.  Right click on the page and "View page source"
5.  Search for `var m_mpageSettingsJSON` and copy that entire variable string (from the `var` to the semi-colon after the `STATUS_DATA` object)
6.  Paste that variable into your new javascript file from step 2. This variable should contain settings for your component (as well as other things). If it doesn't, try refreshing the page or launching again. Ensure your component is on the first viewpoint tab!
7.  Go back to the page source and search for `var m_viewpointJSON`. Copy and paste that variable string. This variable should contain settings for the view and viewpoint.
8.  Save the file. Copy the path to your file. (You can use either full path or relative `.\tests\bedrockMocks\[fileName]`)
9.  Go back to LiveDev and in the `Data Retrieval Settings` section, click the checkbox to `Enable Bedrock Mocks`.
10. Paste/enter the file path to your javascript file (including the file name).
11. Click `Save Configuration`. This will load your bedrockMocks folder into the `Content Server` and load the file(s) in the `Injector`.
12. Click `Launch` (or refreshed your already launched page) and the bedrock mock files should be used.
13. Make changes to your bedrock variables and refresh the page to see them!
