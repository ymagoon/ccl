<p>The Respiratory Therapy Summary MPage is a visual summary of patient information for ventilator settings, respiratory assessments, treatments, and other Respiratory Therapy specific information.  It is used for communication between clinicians, and it aids the decision making process with a single pertinent view of relevant information.  It assists Respiratory Therapy and other disciplines by providing specific ventilation support and oxygenation information during the transition of care.</p>

<p>By using an MPage (customized 






























































































































































































































































<span class='conf-solution-name'>Cerner Millennium</span>&reg; data in an HTML format), relevant data is provided that assists a clinical decision maker. This MPage provides a general summary of patients with an "Inpatient" encounter type for Pulmonologists and Respiratory Therapists, and it is a solution for workflow, monitoring, and transition communication between Respiratory Therapists.  It is not intended to be a replacement for PAL. For example, the MPage can be used to care for a patient who requires a skilled Respiratory Therapist to maintain optimal oxygenation and tissue perfusion. The MPage augments the tasks and information provided in 






























































































































































































































































<span class='conf-solution-name'>PowerChart</span>&reg;. To take full advantage of the MPage, it should be used in conjunction with the ICU Summary, the Inpatient Summary, or the Ambulatory Summary MPages.   </p>

<p>A graph containing the assessments and treatments for Bedrock defined clinical events is available. You can select the data points to be included on the graph as well.  For example, you could select the following items:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sp02</li>
	<li>F102</li>
	<li>Respiratory Rate</li>
	<li>Oxygen Flow Rate</li>
</ul>


<p>In addition, a special component for Apnea, Bradycardia, and Desaturation is available from this MPage.</p>
