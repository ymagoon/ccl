<p>There are a couple of ways for displaying and viewing information on the Rehabilitation Summary 






























































































































































































































































<span class='conf-solution-name'>MPages</span> view. You can use one or more of the options described below to display the appropriate data.</p>


<h3><a name="DisplayingandViewingComponentsUsingRehabilitationSummary-OptionOne%3A"></a>Option One:</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Navigate to the MPage Summary view.</li>
	<li>If a "+" plus sign is displayed to the right of the component title, select it to expand the component. Below are some examples describing the expanded component data.
	<ol>
		<li><b>Lines, Tubes, and Drains component</b> &#45; "+" plus sign expands the component window where the procedure and the documented date and time are displayed.</li>
		<li><b>Allergies component</b> &#45; "+" plus sign expands the Allergies component, which lists each known drug and food allergy for a patient.</li>
		<li><b>Labs component</b> &#45; "+" plus sign expands the Labs component where the result categories like CO2, BUN, and WBC are displayed. The latest and previous results are displayed under a column for the result category as well. A graph can be displayed for a result category when it has an underlined link. For example, if you click CO2 (it has a blue underlined link), the system displays a graph with the MEq/L (milliequivalents/liter) on the Y axis and the date and time on the X axis.

Also, if a lab result has a status of "Modified", the system displays a modify icon (blue triangle) to the right of the most recent version of a result. The status of "Modified" displays when the result value was corrected, or when the date/time of the result was modified, or when a comment was added to a result after it was signed. Also, the Abnormal icon is displayed in the Labs, and Vital Signs components for non-numeric or abnormal results. Beginning with MPages Content Package XXXXX ( MPages Component Library 4.0 (July 2011)) and MPages Bedrock Configuration Content Package XXXXX, XXXXX, XXXXX, and XXXXX (MPages: XXXXX Summary Configuration 4.0 (July 2011)) and its replacement, the Forwarding enhancement became available for the Labs and Vital Signs components.</td></tr></table></div>

			<li>To display a result in the Result viewer, double-click a result row (for example BP for Blood Pressure).  The Result Details window is displayed. The Results Detail window could be a graph of the results for determining trends.  For a row like the Estimated Creatine Clearance, the Milliter a Minute could be on the Y axis and the Date could be on the X axis.  The window could contain a chart of the results by date and time as well.  If you want to mark a result as Reviewed or Signed and notify other parties, you can click the Forward button.  The system displays the Forward pop-up window.  Complete the requested information and click OK.  The system returns you to the Result Details window.
