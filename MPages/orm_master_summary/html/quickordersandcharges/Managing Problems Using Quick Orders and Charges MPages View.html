<p>Managing problems and diagnoses is frequently a part of the ordering workflow. Therefore, the ability to add new problems and diagnoses to a patient's chart is available using the Quick Orders and Charges 







































































































































































































































































<span class='conf-solution-name'>MPages</span>view. To complete these actions, follow the steps below: (ensure the Consolidated Problems component is expanded by clicking the icon in the upper right corner of the Consolidated Problems component)</p>

<ol>
	<li>Adding a new diagnosis, problem or past medical history.
	<ol>
		<li>Below the component heading, the label of "Add new as" provides several options for adding a new problem, diagnosis and/or past medical history.&nbsp;These options include: This Visit, This Visit and Active, Active, Historical.</li>
		<li>Within the search field, begin typing the desired item.&nbsp; The search will display up to 10 of the closest matches based on the text entered.&nbsp; When a nomenclature term is selected from the search and "This Visit" has been selected from the drop-down list, the condition is added to the "This Visit" section, and it is added as a diagnosis using the target vocabulary defined in Bedrock.</li>
		<li>When a nomenclature term is selected from the search and This Visit and Active are selected from the drop-down list, the condition is<br/>
added to the This Visit section as a diagnosis and to the Active section as an active problem using the appropriate target vocabularies defined in Bedrock.</li>
		<li>When a nomenclature term is selected from the search and Active was selected from the drop-down list, the condition is added to the<br/>
Active section as an active problem using the target vocabulary defined in Bedrock.</li>
		<li>When a nomenclature term is selected from the search and Historical was selected from the drop-down list, the condition is added to<br/>
the Historical section as a resolved problem.</li>
		<li>Items can also be dragged and dropped from one section to another (e.g. drag a problem into the "this visit" section to make it a diagnosis).&nbsp; When this is done, the system will apply the appropriate vocabularies as defined in Bedrock.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Performing the actions of Resolve, Inactive and Cancel
	<ol>
		<li>A drop-down list within the component displays the following options: Resolve, Inactivate, and Cancel.</li>
		<li>When a condition in any of the subsections is selected, you are given an indication that the focus has been placed on the condition.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>When focus is placed on a problem in the Active section and Resolved is selected from the drop-down list, the problem status is updated to<br/>
Resolved and the problem is no longer displayed in the Active section, and it is displayed in the Historical section.</li>
	<li>When focus is placed on a problem in the Active section and Inactive is selected from the drop-down list, the problem status is updated to<br/>
Inactive and the problem is no longer displayed in the Active section, and it is displayed in the Historical section.</li>
	<li>When focus is placed on a problem in the Active section and Canceled is selected from the drop-down list, the problem status is updated to<br/>
Canceled and the problem is no longer displayed.</li>
	<li>When focus is placed on a condition in any of the three sections, the actions of Resolve, Inactivate, and Cancel are available with the following exceptions:
	<ol>
		<li>If the condition only consists of a diagnosis, the actions of Resolve, Inactivate, and Cancel are not available.</li>
		<li>If the condition includes problems, and the most recent problem is in a Resolved status, the Resolve action is not available.</li>
		<li>If the condition includes problems, and the most recent problem is in an Inactive status, the Inactivate action is not available.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>When the Resolve, Inactivate, or Cancel action is taken on a condition that includes a diagnosis, no action is taken on the diagnosis.</li>
	<li>When the Resolve action is taken on a condition, the status of the most recent problem changes to Resolved.</li>
	<li>When the Inactivate action is taken on a condition, the status of the most recent problem is updated to Inactive.</li>
	<li>When the Cancel action is taken on a condition, the status of the most recent problem is updated to Canceled.</li>
	<li>The Resolve, Inactivate, and Cancel actions can be taken on conditions that are free-text problems with the following exceptions: a problem in a Resolved status does not have the Resolve action available, and a problem in an Inactive status does not have the Inactivate action available.</li>
	<li>Multiple conditions can be selected within multiple sections, and they can use the Resolve, Inactivate, or Cancel action when each selected condition satisfies the above conditions.
