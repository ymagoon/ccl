# Gaia Linter Plugin

Gaia Linter Plugin uses ESLint and an eslint-plugin called "mpages" specifically made to lint to MPages
standards. By default it will lint any javascript files under "src/main" (ignoring files under an `i18n` folder), but
if your files are under a different directory you can change the path
(see [Changing the File Path](#changing-the-file-path)). In addition, if necessary, you can add your own rules on top
of the MPages Plugin linter rules by using an
[eslintrc](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#using-configuration-files) file.

## How to Lint Your Artifact Files

### Install mpage-gaia

Follow [these instructions](https://github.cerner.com/MPagesEcosystem/mpage-gaia/blob/master/docs/use-gaia.md) to install mpage-gaia into your artifact.

You can add the following to the `scripts` section in your `package.json`, if desired:

```
"lint": "gaia linter:cli" // maxWarnings may optionally be specified here e.g. maxWarnings=10
```

**Note:** Linting will fail if any lint errors are found. The plugin can also
be configured to fail if the number of lint warnings exceeds `maxWarnings`.

### Command Prompt

Open a cmd prompt and run any of the following:

```
npm run lint (to lint with the above script)
npm run gaia linter (to lint without the above script)
npm run gaia server (to see the UI version of Gaia, then click on the MPages Linter tab)
```

**Note:** If you would like to use the linting rules in your IDE, see the `Usage` and `Configure Your IDE` sections here:
https://github.cerner.com/MPagesEcosystem/eslint-plugin-mpages#usage

## Changing the File Path

If your files reside in a path different than `src/main` then you can change the default path the linter looks at by
running the following command (replace `src/main2` with your path):

```
npm run gaia linter:saveSrcPath srcDir=src/main2
```

### To auto fix lint issues

This option instructs ESLint to fix as many issues as possible. The fixes are made to the actual files themselves and only the remaining unfixed issues are output. Not all problems are fixable using this option.

`npm run gaia linter fix=true`
