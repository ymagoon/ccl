# Gaia Linter Plugin

The Gaia Linter plugin allows you to lint your code. Linting is a type
of static analysis that is frequently used to find problematic patterns
and code that do not adhere to certain style guidelines. Code linters
are available for most programming languages, and compilers sometimes
incorporate linting into the compilation process. The Gaia Linter plugin
uses ESLint, an open-source, third-party linter tool for identifying and
reporting on patterns in JavaScript.

To access the Gaia Linter plugin in Gaia, click `MPages Linter` on the
plugin list on the left.

## Configure the Linting Path

The Gaia Linter plugin lints any JavaScript files located in
`src/main` by default. You can change this path on the command line by
running the `saveSrcPath` command and passing the desired directory as
the `srcDir` parameter. For example, run the following command, where
`[location]` is the new linting path:

`npm run gaia linter:saveSrcPath srcDir=[location]`

## Configure the Linting Rules

The Gaia Linter plugin provides a standard set of ESLint rules. You can
change these rules by creating a `.eslintrc` file.
See the [ESLint documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#using-configuration-files) for more information.

## Run the Linter on the Command Line

You can run the linter on the command line using the following default
linter command: `npm run gaia linter`

### Automatically Fix Linting Issues

You can set the linter to automatically fix as many issues as possible.
The fixes are made directly to the files, and only the remaining unfixed
issues are output. Not all problems are fixable using this option. To
enable this functionality, enter the following command:
`npm run gaia linter fix=true`

## Common Issues

If any of your class names definitions in JSDoc contain a period (.),
the following error is displayed in the Gaia Linter plugin: `Cannot read property 'match' of undefined`. To resolve this issue, remove
the period (.) from the JSDoc class name definition.

The following example displays a class name definition incompatible with
the Gaia Linter plugin:

```javascript
/**
Definition of the PatientInformation class.
@class PatientInformation.
*/
```

The following example displays a compatible class name definition:

```javascript
/**
Definition of the PatientInformation class.
@class PatientInformation
*/
```
