# Gaia Unit Testing Plugin

Gaia unit testing plugin uses Karma, Webpack, and Jasmine to run any unit tests in your artifact against your Javascript files.

## How to Run Unit Tests on Your Artifact Files

### Install mpage-gaia

Follow [these instructions](https://github.cerner.com/MPagesEcosystem/mpage-gaia/blob/master/docs/use-gaia.md) to install mpage-gaia into your artifact.

### Running tests via the command prompt

```
npm run gaia unit-testing cli=true
```

Your project package.json should be configured like so:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "test": "gaia unit-testing cli=true",
        "test:browsers": "gaia unit-testing"
    }
}
```

The `test` script is for jenkins builds because it runs in a headless browser, and it exits with status 1 on failure.

The `test:browsers` script simply runs whichever browsers are set in the gaia.json unit-testing config.

### Running test in the Gaia UI:

```
npm run gaia server
```

Then click on the Unit Testing tab

Within the Unit Testing tab there are three more tabs. You can find documentation for it on the [guide](docs/guide.md)

### Troubleshoot common issues

See the _Troubleshooting_ section on the [guide](docs/guide.md).
