# Member

## Usage
`@member [{<type>}] [<name>]`
 
## Overview
Used to identify any member that doesn't have a specialized kind.
When specifying the name of a member, certain naming conventions can specify the scope of the member:
* `<module>#<memberName>` - indicates `memberName` is an instance member.
* `<module>.<memberName>` - indicates `memberName` is a static member.
* `<module>~<memberName>` - indicates `memberName` is an inner member.

## Example
```javascript
/**
 * @member {Object}
 */
 const obj = {};

 
/**
 * @member {String} Person#name  // the instance member named "name."
 */

/**
 * @member {String} Person.name  // the static member named "name."
 */

/**
 *  @member {String} Person~name  // the inner member named "name."
 */
```
