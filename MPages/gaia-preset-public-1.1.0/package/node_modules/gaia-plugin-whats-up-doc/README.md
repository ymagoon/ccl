## Development
### Setting up your dev environment
The simplest way to get started developing with `gaia-plugin-whats-up-doc` is to update the local `mpage-gaia`
node-module to link to your local `gaia-plugin-whats-up-doc`.

1. Clone `gaia-plugin-whats-up-doc`:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.cerner.com:MPagesEcosystem/gaia-plugin-whats-up-doc.git
   cd gaia-plugin-whats-up-doc/
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
3. Make your local `gaia-plugin-whats-up-doc` package linkable:
    ```
    npm link
    ```
4. Update your local `mpage-gaia`'s dependency on `gaia-plugin-whats-up-doc` to point to itself:
    ```
    npm link gaia-plugin-whats-up-doc
    ```
5. Build `gaia-plugin-whats-up-doc`:
    ```
    npm run build:dev
    ```
6. Run `gaia server` locally:
    ```
    npm run gaia:server
    ```

#### NOTE
* You only need to re-run `npm run gaia:server` when you've made a change to the nodejs side of the plugin. Rebuilding
the dist folder when making UI updates is sufficient enough to see those updates in the web application.
* To unlink the local `gaia-plugin-whats-up-doc`: `npm unlink gaia-plugin-whats-up-doc`

## That's all folks!
