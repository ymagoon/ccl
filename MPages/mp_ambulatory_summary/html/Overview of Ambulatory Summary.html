<h2><a name="OverviewofAmbulatorySummary-Overview"></a>Overview </h2>

<p>The Ambulatory Summary MPage is focused on providing a patient summary view for ambulatory clinicians. Additional functionality allows clinicians to take action directly from the summary MPage. In phase one, the actions include the ability to add allergies, the ability to add documentation (

<span class='conf-solution-name'>PowerNote</span>), and the ability to add new orders using the Modal Order Entry window. Also, this phase supports user-based customization, which allows you to rearrange components on the page and to define the default expand/collapse behavior for each component.</p>

<p>The Ambulatory Summary MPage contains the following components:</p>

<p>Patient Information, Diagnoses, Problems, Allergies, Medications, Patient Histories including Past Medical, Procedure, Family History, Social History, Pregnancy History for female patients, Vital Signs and Measurements, General Labs, Diagnostics, Health Maintenance, Immunizations, Visits, Microbiology, Pathology, Documents, New Order Entry, Outstanding Orders, CDC Growth Chart, and Notes and Reminders.</p>

<h2><a name="OverviewofAmbulatorySummary-Workflow"></a>Workflow</h2>

<p>Below is an example of how the Ambulatory Summary fits into a typical workflow:</p>

<ol>
	<li>You have your patient's chart open and the first place you visit is the Ambulatory Summary page.</li>
	<li>You start by reviewing the problems, allergies, medications, and vital signs.</li>
	<li>You take a look at a recent note and now you are ready to see the patient.</li>
	<li>Click the Home icon.</li>
	<li>In this example, the patient is here for a sore throat, and upon physical examination, has a very red and swollen throat with positive lymph nodes. It looks like strep, so you order a Beta Strep and add azithromycin.</li>
	<li>You click Submit for Signature which takes you to the Orders tab.</li>
	<li>From here you can attach your diagnosis to the orders, fill out any required fields, and sign the orders.</li>
	<li>You are automatically taken back to the Ambulatory Summary.  At this point you are finished if you want to complete your documentation later, or you can add your note now.</li>
	<li>Click Add in the Documents section, and from here you can open your note and complete it.</li>
</ol>
