exercise 1 - 
select n.principle_type_cd, n.source_vocabulary_cd, e.person_id, e.organization_id
from nomenclature n, procedure p, encounter e
plan n where n.principle_type_cd > 0 and n.source_vocabulary_cd > 0
join p where p.nomenclature_id = n.nomenclature_id
join e where e.encntr_id = p.encntr_id
order by n.principle_type_cd, n.source_vocabulary_cd, e.person_id, e.organization_id
with maxqual( n, 5000)
go

;Choose a principle_type_cd with a lot of source_vocabulary_cd's


exercise 2 - should perform poorly due to cartesian product

;Choose a large zipcode_key...top offender may be too poor of performer
select a.zipcode_key, x = count( a.zipcode_key)
from address a
group by a.zipcode_key
order by x desc
go


;get a matching dataset for the environment
select a.zipcode_key,
        o.cki, o.clinical_display_line,
        o.dept_misc_line
from 
  address a,
  orders o
where a.parent_entity_id = o.person_id
    and a.zipcode_key = "74477" ;zipcode from above
    and o.cki > " " 
    and o.clinical_display_line > " "
    and o.dept_misc_line > " "
with maxqual( o, 1) 
go

exercise 3 - 
;Exercise 3 should always have executions problems.
;If it doesn't, use the below select and choose a person_id with a higher count

select e.person_id,
       x = count(*)
  from encounter e
  plan e
       where e.person_id > 0
 group by e.person_id
having count(*) > 200
 order by x desc
  with nocounter go



exercise 4 - Change maxqual on first select.
