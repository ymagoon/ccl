If your site is on XR clinical reporting, you'll also need to create a Document Section Viewer privilege to hide these sections from the chart. (instructions below) 
The privilege built should be honored on distributions & expedites of the chart. 

Instructions on how to hide non-chartable reports and report sections from printing on the charts: 
There is a privilege called "Document Section Viewer" that you can build and associate any event codes that should not chart. It is suggested to build the exception group and associate it to all positions with a privilege value of "yes, except for". Then it will need to be defined for Event Codes and then pull over the AP report DTAs that need to be excluded. (Those that need to be non-chartable.) 

NOTE: You will have to make sure to update this every time a new position is added, but it gives you the ability to have non-chartable DTAs with XR Clinical Reporting. 

Additionally, the following reference page link covers how to create report section restrictions:
