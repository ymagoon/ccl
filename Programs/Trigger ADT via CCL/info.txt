Have you ever needed to send an encounter update across the interface, but found there wasn't a built-in mechanism that fit your needs? I ran in to this, and instead of accepting defeat, I decided to eliminate the issue.

 

Attached is a ccl program that you can use to trigger an encounter update (ADT A08) for a given person_id and encounter_id. You can call this directly from ccl, or from the EKM action template.
